# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard

## 🏷️ Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive **Sales Performance Analysis** of an E-Commerce company using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard tracks overall business health by analyzing revenue, order trends, cancellation impact, and product/state-level performance.

The report helps business teams understand:
- Which categories and products drive the most revenue  
- Which states contribute significantly to sales  
- How cancellations affect profits  
- Revenue trends across months and quarters  
- Customer purchasing behavior patterns

## ⭐ Executive Summary

### 📍 Business Problem
The E-Commerce business lacked a consolidated view of:
- Revenue distribution across products and regions  
- Cancellation rate impact on business  
- Which categories drive maximum profit  
- Monthly & quarterly performance trends  
- Customer order behavior  

Without this, decision-making was slow and reactive.

### 📍 Solution
A Power BI–based analytical dashboard was created with:
- KPI cards for quick business understanding  
- Product, category, and state-level revenue breakdown  
- Revenue trend visualization across quarters  
- Date-range slicer for dynamic filtering  
- Cancellation analysis to quantify lost business  

This allows management to quickly assess performance and identify growth opportunities.
